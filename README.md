MATemplate by hemmlmann
=======================

a basic matrix template for c++ that actually works. surprisingly.

=======================

<b>features:</b>
 + create matrices of different datatypes
 + do basic arithmetic on them
 + transpose them
 + output them to the console

<b>what's currently not working</b> (but one day will):
 - inverting a matrix
 - truly randomly initializing a matrix <i>(dummy-function implemented)</i>
 - importing matrices from .txt/.csv/etc...
 - actual exception handling <i>(again: dummies already in place)</i>
 - other cool stuff that i'll have to think of first

========================
if you want a <i>very</i> basic tutorial on how this template works, please look
at the main.cpp file because i'm too lazy to write a proper documentation ;)
